# Expy's Language

The first version of Expy only has two functions which are:
```chat() # RBLX Only``` and ```holdkey()```
To use chat simply do ```chat(yourmessagehere)```
Expy's language doesn't use "" or , Instead It uses and underscore _

For the holdkey function do this:
```holdkey(yourkey_number)```
The number is the ammount of time the key is held, 0 will just be a key click.
yourkey must only be one character, like this: "w_1" "s_1" "d_1" "a_1"
